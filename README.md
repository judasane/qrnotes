# QRnotes
With QRnotes you can upload photos literally anyWHERE, based on unique QRcode stickers you can upload and retrieve files in any surface, like a notebook, a table or anywhere you want.
For use it you just need to scan the code (it will take you to a upload page, where you upload the content you want), after you can acces that content just by scanning again.
